Project Status:

This is largely working, you can move pieces around the board, artillery fire works, yada yada.

To Dos:

* After moving, the moving player needs to decide which pieces to engage where. This should happen within games.coffee

* Enable web-sockets, so that players can see when their opponent moves without having to refresh the page

* Log-in, and allowing players to move only their own pieces

* Adding some tests would be, ahem, maybe not so bad, wokka wokka
